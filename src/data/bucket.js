/**
 * The `Bucket` interface is the single point of knowledge about turning vector
 * tiles into WebGL buffers.
 *
 * `Bucket` is an abstract interface. An implementation exists for each style layer type.
 * Create a bucket via the `StyleLayer#createBucket` method.
 *
 * The concrete bucket types, using layout options from the style layer,
 * transform feature geometries into vertex and index data for use by the
 * vertex shader.  They also (via `ProgramConfiguration`) use feature
 * properties and the zoom level to populate the attributes needed for
 * data-driven styling.
 *
 * Buckets are designed to be built when tile is loaded and then converted (uploaded)
 * to tune bucket's vertex, index, and attribute data for consumption by WebGL.
